                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Terrorism has always existed and spread fear throughout the world. Even major events in history such as World War 1&2 were a result of terrorism. Terrorism always comes in cycles, an individual or a group rises and fear of them is spread. Eventually as time goes on that group’s impact begins to fade away. This is either due to a decrease in the acts of terrorism or the disbanding of the group. A new group then emerges and continues the cycle.</p>
                    <p> As of now, we are in the middle of the cycle, where the fear of the groups are on the rise. This fear really blew up after 9/11.</p>
                    <p> …</p>
                    <p>Bad pun intended.</p>
                    <p>9/11 was a horrific event that led to the deaths of over 2,000 people, orchestrated by a muslim terrorist group named Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda’s actions left people shocked and terrified about what they could do and what they could continue to do. They were already so powerful that they could infiltrate both our country and our airlines. This realization led to an increase in background checks when entering America and increased airport security when flying in America. Although we have put these safety measures into effect, we have to ask ourselves: Is this enough?</p>
                    <p> For many people, the answer is no. We do not have enough protection against these kinds of attacks. Especially since the perpetrators of 9/11 were a group of Muslims, which is the world’s second largest religion. Although we can better observe the Muslims coming into the country, we already have millions of Muslims currently living in America. This makes it a lot more difficult to check up on them, considering that they have not done anything to warrant such suspicions. However, due to the nature of the terrorist act, many people find it justifiable to place Muslim neighborhoods under surveillance. </p>
                    <p>The possibility that the ideals and beliefs of Islam(the religion Muslims follow) have the potential to turn into the ideals of Al-Qaeda is a fact that cant be ignored. Although Al-Qaeda is a very extreme version of Islam, it’s still a branch of the Islamic beliefs. This possibility terrifies people and is what led to the idea of surveillance. Putting these neighborhoods under surveillance would allow us to get a better idea of what goes on in these communities. Instead of sitting and waiting for another attack, we would be able to prevent future incidents. Any possible terrorist act would immediately be recorded and sent to the officials. Necessary action would be taken to prevent the possibility of threat, resulting in little to no casualties.</p>
