                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Terrorism has always existed and spread fear throughout the world. Even major events in history such as World War 1&2 were a result of terrorism. Terrorism always comes in cycles, an individual or a group rises and fear of them is spread. Eventually as time goes on that group’s impact begins to fade away. This is either due to a decrease in the acts of terrorism or the disbanding of the group. A new group then emerges and continues the cycle.</p>
                    <p>9/11 shook America and its perception of the Muslim people. Although Islam is the second most popular religion in the world, people dont really know much about it. The average person might know a muslim coworker or even a muslim friend, but besides that, they wouldn’t know anything. All they really know is that these people produced a terrorist group.</p>
                    <p>Knowing this, it’s easy to see why people would want to put Muslims under surveillance. But if you stop and think about it, you’ll realize that doing this doesn’t make much sense. Muslims have lived among us for years, way before the 9/11 incident. Just because they’ve received some negative attention does not throw away all the good things they have done in the past. One small group of individuals does not represent the entirety of the religion. Every group in the world has spawned bad people, but that never meant the group itself was bad. Why is this Muslim scenario any different?</p>
                    <p>Even without the matter of their groups innocence, putting Muslims under surveillance is a major breach of privacy. Watching and recording their personal lives goes against the morals this country is built on. If they were proven to be known criminals and were on probation, then that would be understandable. But these are not criminals, they’re ordinary people who’ve done nothing wrong. They’re no different than any other person and they don’t deserve to be treated as threats.</p>
                    <p>Although it’s easy to get caught up in fear and confusion, doing so is never the right option. If we abandon hope and reason, we’re just doing what the terrorists want. They want to spread fear and panic. By putting Muslims under surveillance, we’re telling these extremists that they’ve won, that they beat us. B[ut they didn’t, we’re better than that. We don’t succumb to our fears that easily. We shake them off and continue to oppose these radical groups, the right way.</p>
